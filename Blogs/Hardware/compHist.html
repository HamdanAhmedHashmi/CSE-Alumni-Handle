        <h1 style="font-weight:650 ;">Brief History of Computers</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The history of computers is split into "generations". We will primarily focus on the third generation of
            computers, which began in the 1960s, and the microcomputer technology of today, which has meant that
            computers are now present in the homes of many people across the world.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The History of Computing Hardware (1960-Present)</h2>
        <p>
            The history of computing hardware starting at 1960 is marked by the conversion from vacuum tube to
            solid-state devices such as the transistor and later the integrated circuit. By 1959 discrete transistors
            were considered sufficiently reliable and economical that they made further vacuum tube computers
            uncompetitive. Computer main memory slowly moved away from magnetic core memory devices to solid-state
            static and dynamic semiconductor memory, which greatly reduced the cost, size and power consumption of
            computers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Third generation</h2>
        <p>
            The mass increase in the use of computers accelerated with 'Third Generation' computers. These generally
            relied on Jack Kilby's invention of the integrated circuit (or microchip), starting around 1966 in the
            commercial market.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first integrated circuit was produced in September 1958, and computers using them began to appear in the
            early 1960s, for example the 1961 Semiconductor Network Computer (Molecular Electronic Computer, Mol-E-Com),
            first monolithic integrated circuit general purpose computer (built for demonstration purposes, programmed
            to simulate a desk calculator) was built by Texas Instruments for the US Air Force.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of their early uses were in embedded systems, notably used by NASA for the Apollo Guidance Computer, by
            the military in the LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile, the Honeywell ALERT airborne
            computer, and in the Central Air Data Computer used for flight control in the US Navy's F-14A Tomcat fighter
            jet.
        </p>
        <p>An early commercial use was the 1965 SDS 92. IBM first used ICs in computers for the logic of the System/360
            Model 85 shipped in 1969 and then made extensive use of ICs in its System/370 which began shipment in 1971.
        </p>
        <p>
            The integrated circuit enabled the development of much smaller computers. The minicomputer was a significant
            innovation in the 1960s and 1970s. It brought computing power to more people, not only through more
            convenient physical size but also through broadening the computer vendor field. Digital Equipment
            Corporation became the number two computer company behind IBM with their popular PDP and VAX computer
            systems. Smaller, affordable hardware also brought about the development of important new operating systems
            such as Unix.
        </p>
        <p>
            In November 1966, Hewlett-Packard introduced the 2116A minicomputer, one of the first commercial 16-bit
            computers. It used CTµL (Complementary Transistor MicroLogic) in integrated circuits from Fairchild
            Semiconductor. Hewlett-Packard followed this with similar 16-bit computers, such as the 2115A in 1967, the
            2114A in 1968, and others.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1969, Data General introduced the Nova and shipped a total of 50,000 at $8,000 each. The popularity of
            16-bit computers, such as the Hewlett-Packard 21xx series and the Data General Nova, led the way toward word
            lengths that were multiples of the 8-bit byte. The Nova was first to employ medium-scale integration (MSI)
            circuits from Fairchild Semiconductor, with subsequent models using large-scale integrated (LSI) circuits.
            Also notable was that the entire central processor was contained on one 15-inch printed circuit board.
        </p>
        <p>
            Large mainframe computers used ICs to increase storage and processing abilities. The 1965 IBM System/360
            mainframe computer family are sometimes called third-generation computers; however their logic consisted
            primaritly of SLT hybrid circuits, which contained discrete transistors and diodes interconnected on a
            substrate with printed wires and printed passive components; the S/360 M85 and M91 did use ICs for some of
            their circuits. IBM's 1971 System/370 used ICs for their logic.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Fourth generation</h2>
        <p>
            The basis of the fourth generation was the invention of the microprocessor by a team at Intel.
            Third generation minicomputers were essentially scaled-down versions of mainframe computers, whereas the
            fourth generation's origins are fundamentally different.
        </p>
        <p>
            Microprocessor-based computers were originally very limited in their computational ability and speed, and
            were in no way an attempt to downsize the minicomputer. They were addressing an entirely different market.
        </p>
        <p>
            Processing power and storage capacities have grown beyond all recognition since the 1970s, but the
            underlying technology has remained basically the same of large-scale integration (LSI) or very-large-scale
            integration(VLSI) microchips, so it is widely regarded that most of today's computers still belong to the
            fourth generation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Microprocessors</h2>
        <p>
            On November 15, 1971, Intel released the world's first commercial microprocessor, the 4004. It was developed
            for a Japanese calculator company called Busicom as an alternative to hardwired circuitry, but computers
            were developed around it, with much of their processing abilities provided by one small microprocessor chip.
            The RAM chip was based on an invention by Robert Dennard of IBM, offering kilobits of memory on one chip.
            Intel coupled the RAM chip with the microprocessor, allowing fourth generation computers to be smaller and
            faster than prior computers. The 4004 was only capable of 60,000 instructions per second, but its successors
            brought ever-growing speed and power to computers, including the Intel 8008, 8080 (used in many computers
            using the CP/M operating system), and the 8086/8088 family. (The IBM personal computer (PC) and compatibles
            use processors that are still backwards-compatible with the 8086.) Other producers also made microprocessors
            which were widely used in microcomputers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following table shows a timeline of significant microprocessor development.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Supercomputers</h2>
        <p>
            The powerful supercomputers of the era were at the other end of the computing spectrum from the
            microcomputers, and they also used integrated circuit technology. In 1976, the Cray-1 was developed by
            Seymour Cray, who had left Control Data in 1972 to form his own company. This machine was the first
            supercomputer to make vector processing practical. It had a characteristic horseshoe shape to speed
            processing by shortening circuit paths. Vector processing uses one instruction to perform the same operation
            on many arguments; it has been a fundamental supercomputer processing method ever since. The Cray-1 could
            calculate 150 million floating point operations per second (150 megaflops). 85 were shipped at a price of $5
            million each. The Cray-1 had a CPU that was mostly constructed of SSI and MSI ECL ICs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Mainframes and minicomputers</h2>
        <p>
            Computers were generally large, costly systems owned by large institutions before the introduction of the
            microprocessor in the early 1970s — corporations, universities, government agencies, and the like. Users
            were experienced specialists who did not usually interact with the machine itself, but instead prepared
            tasks for the computer on off-line equipment, such as card punches. A number of assignments for the computer
            would be gathered up and processed in batch mode. After the jobs had completed, users could collect the
            output printouts and punched cards. In some organizations, it could take hours or days between submitting a
            job to the computing center and receiving the output.
        </p>
        <p>
            A more interactive form of computer use developed commercially by the middle 1960s. In a time-sharing
            system, multiple teleprinter terminals let many people share the use of one mainframe computer processor.
            This was common.
        </p>
        <p>
            A different model of computer use was foreshadowed by the way in which early, pre-commercial, experimental
            computers were used, where one user had exclusive use of a processor. Some of the first computers that might
            be called "personal" were early minicomputers such as the LINC and PDP-8, and later on VAX and larger
            minicomputers from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Data General, Prime Computer, and others. They
            originated as peripheral processors for mainframe computers, taking on some routine tasks and freeing the
            processor for computation. By today's standards, they were physically large (about the size of a
            refrigerator) and costly (typically tens of thousands of US dollars), and thus were rarely purchased by
            individuals. However, they were much smaller, less expensive, and generally simpler to operate than the
            mainframe computers of the time, and thus affordable by individual laboratories and research projects.
            Minicomputers largely freed these organizations from the batch processing and bureaucracy of a commercial or
            university computing center.
