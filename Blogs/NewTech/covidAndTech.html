        <h1 style="font-weight:650 ;">Covid-19 and the New Technologies</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Advances in hardware and software development, data analysis
            needs, security considerations, medical emergencies, sustainability,
            privacy concerns, connectivity, and communication have all inspired
            the latest technology trends. The unexpected switch to remote and hybrid
            working has fueled a lot of progress in the tech world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though the limitations on movement and assembly brought about by the
            COVID-19 pandemic hampered tech projects, there are still many innovative
            technologies to look out for in 2022. Companies have become more agile,
            adapting to the new normal and releasing upgraded technologies to help
            other businesses manage their work.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>AI-powered cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>
            The steep increase in cyberattacks, email phishing scams, and ransomware is
            forcing cybersecurity firms to search for tech solutions to address the
            vulnerabilities. Criminals are hacking individuals’ accounts, countries’
            critical infrastructure, and businesses of all sizes, causing millions of
            dollars in losses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Workplace digitization and remote working in response to the COVID-19
            virus made it a priority to retrain employees on online safety to reduce
            data breaches and losses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Businesses are also adopting new cybersecurity technologies, such as
            artificial intelligence (AI), to monitor and guard networks against
            hackers in real-time rather than responding to the threat after the
            damage is already done. Moreover, cloud storage companies are offering
            end-to-end encryption for online data storage and data transfers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>5G technology adoption</h2>
        <p>According to Ericsson’s Mobility Report, published by Statista Research,
            5G technology subscriptions will surpass one billion this year.
            While 4G brought significant improvements, for example, in streaming videos
            seamlessly, 5G has 100 times the speed, meaning that uploads, downloads,
            data transfers, and streams will be much faster.
        </p>
        <p>5G will boost the Internet of Things (IoT), which involves internet-powered
            smart devices linking and operating together. Unlike with 4G, many devices
            can connect to the 5G network without a significant drop in speed, latency,
            and reliability. That’s because of the network-slicing feature that creates
            independent networks offering different services for each device.
        </p>
        <p>Furthermore, while 4G mobile networks struggle with connectivity in a crowded
            location, 5G can transmit its radio waves to as many as one million devices
            per square kilometer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Internet of Behaviors (IoB)</h2>
        <p>
            A lot of customer data is collected by service providers through IoT devices in
            the home. Businesses are using analytics and big data techniques to determine the
            data’s value in what is now known as the Internet of Behaviors (IoB).
        </p>
        <p>
            By reviewing this customer information, businesses can personalize their services,
            market their products, and improve a customer’s experience with the company.
        </p>
        <p>
            While personalized solutions are important, companies face an uphill battle convincing
            users to share personal data with them to develop these solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Website hacking and other cybersecurity challenges also make customers
            uncomfortable about risking their privacy in return for valuable services.
            A different approach to data collection will be vital for businesses’ data analysis needs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Metaverse</h2>
        <p>
            Facebook’s name change to Meta put a spotlight on the metaverse, described as the next
            evolution in social connectivity. The metaverse is a virtual, three-dimensional space
            that people can log into as avatars to socialize, work, shop, collaborate, or play games together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Companies are investing in novel technologies to bring the metaverse to life, such as
            virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). For example, VR headsets enable
            people to explore and immerse themselves in digital worlds and share experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Metaverse real estate sales reached $501 million last year and have already topped
            $85 million this year, according to MetaMetric Solutions. Thanks to blockchain
            technology, people can own these virtual assets or even make in-game purchases.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Clean technology (cleantech)</h2>
        <p>
            The desire for sustainable living is influencing the development of new technologies
            known as clean technologies–or cleantech, in short. Cleantech reduces the environmental
            impact of products or services while optimizing the use of natural resources. Renewable
            energy has been the most notable attempt at developing sustainable technologies, with wind,
            hydroelectric, and solar power having a lower carbon footprint than fossil fuels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, the top cleantech trends include rechargeable batteries, electric vehicles and
            motors, solar panel development, biofuel-powered turbo generators, and waste management
            technologies. Since mining cryptocurrency is harmful to the environment, some businesses
            are offering alternative crypto coins, such as Chia and Cardano, which are less energy-consuming
            than the likes of Bitcoin.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Educational technology (edtech)</h2>
        <p>
            The COVID-19 pandemic fuelled school closures worldwide, hurting the educational sector and
            class learning for billions of students. Educational technology (edtech) companies have
            emerged to provide solutions by creating digital platforms for remote learning. Investments
            in the e-learning industry are increasing as startups form to innovate online education
            software and video conferencing technologies to give students access to teachers and courses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Online classes can be made fun and engaging by gamifying the experience. Integrating AI into
            the teaching platforms personalizes the coursework, tracks students’ learning styles, provides
            reports on their progress, and automates grading.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, AI simplifies the curriculum-creation process by reviewing the educational content
            available and highlighting what should be included in the lessons.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Collaborative technologies</h2>
        <p>
            Office workers were restricted from going back to the office due to the COVID-19 safety guidelines.
            Thus, companies shifted to remote working, using collaborative technologies to recreate office
            settings, employee engagements, and workflows. Companies that design collaborative tools went
            back to the drawing board, upgrading their services to meet the new and unexpected demand for
            shared online workspaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most common collaborative technologies come from Google Workspace and Microsoft Teams. Both
            offer proprietary project management apps, third-party integrated apps, messaging apps, voice
            calling, and video conferencing tools for their digital workspaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary benefits of collaborative technologies are document synchronization and employee
            communication in real-time, ensuring work can be completed efficiently.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Telehealth</h2>
        <p>
            Another outcome of the pandemic has been the increased investment in telehealth services,
            which encompasses remote monitoring, diagnoses, evaluations, and doctor–patient consultations.
            People with mental health concerns can also reach out to online counselors for guidance and
            support. Innovative telecare health monitoring devices track lifestyle changes and internal
            body states, thereby predicting potential health emergencies such as heart conditions. Other
            technologies improving contactless patient interactions include telemedicine robots and surgical
            robots.
        </p>
        <p>
            Machine learning algorithms are also being applied to the telehealth field. The AI can scan
            data to select patients who should enroll in telehealth programs and send alerts if a patient’s
            health metrics exceed a predefined threshold. As a result, doctors can have better control over
            a patient’s day-to-day treatment.
        </p>
