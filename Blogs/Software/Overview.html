        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>AI and Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has already received a lot of buzz in the past decade, but it continues to
            be one of the new technology trends because of its notable effects on how we live, work and play are only in
            the early stages. AI is already known for its superiority in image and speech recognition, navigation apps,
            smartphone personal assistants, ride-sharing apps and so much more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other than that AI will be used further to analyze interactions to determine underlying connections and
            insights, to help predict demand for services like hospitals enabling authorities to make better decisions
            about resource utilization, and to detect the changing patterns of customer behaviour by analyzing data in
            near real-time, driving revenues and enhancing personalized experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            The AI market will grow to a $190 billion industry by 2025 with global spending on cognitive and AI systems
            reaching over $57 billion in 2022. With AI spreading its wings across sectors, new jobs will be created in
            development, programming, testing, support and maintenance, to name a few. On the other hand AI also offers
            some of the highest salaries today ranging from over $1,25,000 per year (machine learning engineer) to
            $145,000 per year (AI architect) - making it the top new technology trend you must watch out for!
        </p>
        <p>
            Machine Learning the subset of AI, is also being deployed in all kinds of industries, creating a huge demand
            for skilled professionals. Forrester predicts AI, machine learning, and automation will create 9 percent of
            new U.S. jobs by 2025, jobs including robot monitoring professionals, data scientists, automation
            specialists, and content curators, making it another new technology trend you must keep in mind too!
        </p>
        <p>
            Mastering AI and machine learning will help you secure jobs like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>AI Research Scientist</li>
            <li>AI Engineer</li>
            <li>Machine Learning Engineer</li>
            <li>AI Architect</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</h2>
        <p>
            Like AI and Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, is another technology that is automating
            jobs. RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as interpreting applications,
            processing transactions, dealing with data, and even replying to emails. RPA automates repetitive tasks that
            people used to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Forrester Research estimates RPA automation will threaten the livelihood of 230 million or more
            knowledge workers or approximately 9 percent of the global workforce, RPA is also creating new jobs while
            altering existing jobs. McKinsey finds that less than 5 percent of occupations can be totally automated, but
            about 60 percent can be partially automated.
        </p>
        <p>
            For you as an IT professional looking to the future and trying to understand latest technology trends, RPA
            offers plenty of career opportunities, including developer, project manager, business analyst, solution
            architect and consultant. And these jobs pay well. An RPA developer can earn over ₹534K per year - making it
            the next technology trend you must keep a watch on!
        </p>
        <p><b>Mastering RPA will help you secure high paying jobs like:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>RPA Developer</li>
            <li>RPA Analyst</li>
            <li>RPA Architect</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Edge Computing</h2>
        <p>
            Formerly a new technology trend to watch, cloud computing has become mainstream, with major players AWS
            (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform dominating the market. The adoption of
            cloud computing is still growing, as more and more businesses migrate to a cloud solution. But it’s no
            longer the emerging technology trend. Edge is.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the quantity of data organizations is dealing with continues to increase, they have realized the
            shortcomings of cloud computing in some situations. Edge computing is designed to help solve some of those
            problems as a way to bypass the latency caused by cloud computing and getting data to a data center for
            processing. It can exist “on the edge,” if you will, closer to where computing needs to happen. For this
            reason, edge computing can be used to process time-sensitive data in remote locations with limited or no
            connectivity to a centralized location. In those situations, edge computing can act like mini datacenters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Edge computing will increase as use of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices increases. By 2022, the global
            edge computing market is expected to reach $6.72 billion. And this new technology trend is only meant to
            grow and nothing less, creating various jobs, primarily for software engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keeping in line with cloud computing (including new-age edge and quantum computing) will help you grab
            amazing jobs like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cloud Reliability Engineer</li>
            <li>Cloud Infrastructure Engineer</li>
            <li>Cloud Architect and Security Architect</li>
            <li>DevOps Cloud Engineer</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Quantum Computing</h2>
        <p>
            Next remarkable technology trend is quantum computing, which is a form of computing that takes advantage of
            quantum phenomena like superposition and quantum entanglement. This amazing technology trend is also
            involved in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and to develop potential vaccines, thanks to its
            ability to easily query, monitor, analyze and act on data, regardless of the source. Another field where
            quantum computing is finding applications is banking and finance, to manage credit risk, for high-frequency
            trading and fraud detection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Quantum computers are now a multitude times faster than regular computers and huge brands like Splunk,
            Honeywell, Microsoft, AWS, Google and many others are now involved in making innovations in the field of
            Quantum Computing. The revenues for the global quantum computing market are projected to surpass $2.5
            billion by 2029. And to make a mark in this new trending technology, you need to have experience with
            quantum mechanics, linear algebra, probability, information theory, and machine learning.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality</h2>
        <p>
            The next exceptional technology trend - Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), and Extended
            Reality (ER). VR immerses the user in an environment while AR enhances their environment. Although this
            technology trend has primarily been used for gaming thus far, it has also been used for training, as with
            VirtualShip, a simulation software used to train U.S. Navy, Army and Coast Guard ship captains.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2022, we can expect these forms of technologies being further integrated into our lives. Usually working
            in tandem with some of the other emerging technologies we’ve mentioned in this list, AR and VR have enormous
            potential in training, entertainment, education, marketing, and even rehabilitation after an injury. Either
            could be used to train doctors to do surgery, offer museum goers a deeper experience, enhance theme parks,
            or even enhance marketing, as with this Pepsi Max bus shelter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fun fact: 14 million AR and VR devices were sold in 2019. The global AR and VR market is expected to grow to
            $209.2 billion by 2022, only creating more opportunities in the trending technology, and welcoming more
            professionals ready for this game-changing field.
        </p>
        <p>
            While some employers might look for optics as a skill-set, note that getting started in VR doesn’t require a
            lot of specialized knowledge - basic programming skills and a forward-thinking mindset can land a job;
            another reason why this new technology trend should make up to your list of lookouts!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Blockchain</h2>
        <p>
            Although most people think of blockchain technology in relation to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin,
            blockchain offers security that is useful in many other ways. In the simplest of terms, blockchain can be
            described as data you can only add to, not take away from, or change. Hence the term “chain” because you’re
            making a chain of data. Not being able to change the previous blocks is what makes it so secure. In
            addition, blockchains are consensus-driven, so no one entity can take control of the data. With blockchain,
            you don’t need a trusted third-party to oversee or validate transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several industries are involving and implementing blockchain, and as the use of blockchain technology
            increases, so too does the demand for skilled professionals. From a birds eye view, a blockchain developer
            specializes in developing and implementing architecture and solutions using blockchain technology. The
            average yearly salary of a blockchain developer is ₹469K.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are intrigued by Blockchain and its applications and want to make your career in this trending
            technology, then this is the right time to start. To get into Blockchain, you need to have hands-on
            experience of programming languages, the fundamentals of OOPS, flat and relational databases, data
            structures, web app development, and networking.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Mastering blockchain can help you scale up in a variety of fields and industries:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Risk Analyst</li>
            <li>Tech Architect</li>
            <li>Crypto Community Manager</li>
            <li>Front End Engineer</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Internet of Things (IoT)</h2>
        <p>
            Another promising new technology trend is IoT. Many “things” are now being built with WiFi connectivity,
            meaning they can be connected to the Internet—and to each other. Hence, the Internet of Things, or IoT. The
            Internet of Things is the future, and has already enabled devices, home appliances, cars and much more to be
            connected to and exchange data over the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            As consumers, we’re already using and benefitting from IoT. We can lock our doors remotely if we forget to
            when we leave for work and preheat our ovens on our way home from work, all while tracking our fitness on
            our Fitbits. However, businesses also have much to gain now and in the near future. The IoT can enable
            better safety, efficiency and decision making for businesses as data is collected and analyzed. It can
            enable predictive maintenance, speed up medical care, improve customer service, and offer benefits we
            haven’t even imagined yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            And we’re only in the beginning stages of this new technology trend: Forecasts suggest that by 2030 around
            50 billion of these IoT devices will be in use around the world, creating a massive web of interconnected
            devices spanning everything from smartphones to kitchen appliances. The global spending on the Internet of
            Things (IoT) is forecast to reach 1.1 trillion U.S. dollars in 2022. New technologies such as 5G is expected
            to drive market growth in the coming years.
        </p>
        <p>
            And if you wish to step foot in this trending technology, you will have to learn about Information security,
            AI and machine learning fundamentals, networking, hardware interfacing, data analytics, automation,
            understanding of embedded systems, and must have device and design knowledge.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>5G</h2>
        <p>
            The next technology trend that follows the IoT is 5G. Where 3G and 4G technologies have enabled us to browse
            the internet, use data driven services, increased bandwidths for streaming on Spotify or YouTube and so much
            more, 5G services are expected to revolutionize our lives. by enabling services that rely on advanced
            technologies like AR and VR, alongside cloud based gaming services like Google Stadia, NVidia GeForce Now
            and much more. It is expected to be used in factories, HD cameras that help improve safety and traffic
            management, smart grid control and smart retail too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just about every telecom company like Verizon, Tmobile, Apple, Nokia Corp, QualComm, are now working on
            creating 5G applications. 5G Networks will cover 40% of the world by 2024, handling 25% of all mobile
            traffic data making it an emerging technology trend you must watch out for, and also save a spot in.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
        <p>
            Cyber security might not seem like an emerging technology, given that it has been around for a while, but it
            is evolving just as other technologies are. That’s in part because threats are constantly new. The
            malevolent hackers who are trying to illegally access data are not going to give up any time soon, and they
            will continue to find ways to get through even the toughest security measures. It’s also in part because new
            technology is being adapted to enhance security. As long as we have hackers, cybersecurity will remain a
            trending technology because it will constantly evolve to defend against those hackers.
        </p>
        <p>
            As proof of the strong need for cybersecurity professionals, the number of cybersecurity jobs is growing
            three times faster than other tech jobs. According to Gartner, by 2025, 60% of organizations will use
            cybersecurity risk as a primary determinant in conducting third-party transactions and business engagements.
        </p>
        <p>
            You must note that however challenging the field is it also offers lucrative six-figure incomes, and roles
            can range from
        <ul>
